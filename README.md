MENTOR NAME: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR



### *Technologies Used*

1. *Java SE (Standard Edition)*
   Java serves as the foundation of the project. Core Java is used to manage data structures, handle file I/O, and implement object-oriented programming principles.

2. *Machine Learning Libraries*

   * *Apache Mahout*: An open-source machine learning library designed to create scalable recommender systems using collaborative filtering and clustering algorithms. It supports integration with Hadoop for large-scale processing.
   * *Weka*: A Java-based collection of ML algorithms for data mining tasks, used mainly for experimentation and prototyping.
   * *Deeplearning4j (DL4J)*: A deep learning framework for Java that supports building advanced neural-based recommendation models if needed.

3. *Data Handling and Serialization*

   * *Gson* or *Jackson* libraries for converting between Java objects and JSON data.
   * *Java Collections Framework* for storing user-item interactions and metadata.

4. *Database*

   * *MySQL, **PostgreSQL, or **MongoDB* to store user profiles, item data, ratings, and recommendation history.

5. *User Interface (Optional)*

   * *JavaFX* or *Swing* for building a simple desktop interface for users to input preferences and view recommendations.
   * Alternatively, a *Spring Boot* REST API can be developed for integrating with web or mobile applications.

6. *Build Tools*

   * *Maven* or *Gradle* for managing dependencies and compiling the project.


### *System Architecture*

The recommendation system is structured into several modular components:

1. *Data Collection*
   User data, item metadata, and interaction history (e.g., clicks, ratings, purchases) are gathered from databases or input files. This raw data forms the basis for training and generating recommendations.

2. *Data Preprocessing*
   The collected data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed into a suitable format for analysis. Feature engineering may be used to enhance the quality of input data.

3. *Recommendation Engine*

   * *Collaborative Filtering*: Recommends items based on what similar users liked (user-based) or what similar items were liked by a user (item-based).
   * *Content-Based Filtering*: Uses item metadata (e.g., genre, type, category) to find items similar to those a user has liked before.
   * *Hybrid Models*: Combine both approaches to improve recommendation accuracy.

4. *Model Execution and Output*
   Based on the chosen algorithm, the model calculates item scores for each user and returns a list of top-N recommendations. These can be displayed through a GUI or a web interface.


### *Features of the System*

* *Personalization*: Each user gets unique suggestions based on their behavior or profile.
* *Scalability*: Apache Mahout and Java multithreading ensure performance with large datasets.
* *Real-Time Updates*: System can be extended to update recommendations based on real-time user actions.
* *Extensibility*: New algorithms, user metrics, or data sources can be integrated easily.


### *Applications and Use Cases*

* *E-Commerce*: Recommend products based on user purchase history and browsing patterns.
* *Streaming Services*: Suggest movies, shows, or music based on previous viewing behavior.
* *Online Education*: Recommend courses or learning materials tailored to a studentâ€™s progress.
* *Social Networks*: Suggest friends, pages, or content based on interaction patterns.
